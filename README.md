Project Summary: RSGymPT User Management System (Authentication and Authorization System).
A C# application implementing a robust user management system with role-based access control (RBAC).
Key Technical Highlights:

- Architecture & Design:

1 - Clean Architecture
Strict separation of concerns (Services, Repositories, Models)
Interface-driven development (Heavy use of dependency injection)
SOLID principles implementation
Repository pattern for data access

2 - Advanced Object-Oriented Programming:
Interface segregation (IUser, IAdminUser, IPowerUser, ISimpleUser)
Inheritance hierarchy
Polymorphism through interfaces
Strong encapsulation

- Design Patterns:

Repository Pattern
Dependency Injection
Service Pattern
Factory Pattern (User creation)

- Security Features:

Role-based access control (RBAC)
Password encryption implementation
Secure user authentication
Different user privilege levels (Admin, PowerUser, SimpleUser)

- Technical Implementation:

1 - C# Features:
Interface-based programming
Generics and collections
Enum usage for type safety
Property auto-implementation
Access modifiers for security

2 - System Architecture:
Modular design with clear boundaries
Service-oriented architecture
Extensible user management system
Clear separation of business logic
